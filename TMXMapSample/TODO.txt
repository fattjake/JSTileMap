Loose todo list

- optimization!
	- tile objects being drawn more efficiently?
	- blending mode on back-most layer could be optimized?

- better accessors.
	- wrapper for getting GID for a layer based on coords rather than the layer info.
	- possible tile at coord given z depth?

- is our default position in the right place?  Is it centered or bottom-left?

- can we use better zip support rather than using a 3rd party lib for this?

- ISO object positions and tile object positions are incorrect.

- preliminary macOS support added.  Still has points / pixels issues.
